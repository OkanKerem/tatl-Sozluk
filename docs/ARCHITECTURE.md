# Tatlı Sözlük Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture and design patterns used in the Tatlı Sözlük project.

## Project Structure

The application is structured as follows:

```
lib/
├── main.dart             # Application entry point
├── models/               # Data models
├── pages/                # Screen implementations
├── providers/            # State management
├── services/             # API and backend services
└── utils/                # Utility classes and functions
```

## Design Patterns

### Provider Pattern

The application uses the Provider pattern for state management. This allows for efficient data sharing between widgets and separation of business logic from UI components.

### Repository Pattern

Data access is abstracted through repository classes, which provide a clean API for the rest of the application to consume without knowing the details of data sources.

## Key Components

### Authentication

User authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication, providing secure login methods.

### Data Storage

Firebase Firestore is used as the primary database for storing:
- User profiles
- Entries
- Comments
- Likes

### State Management

The application uses several providers to manage state:
- UserProvider: Manages user authentication state
- EntryProvider: Handles entry data and operations
- CommentProvider: Manages comments on entries
- SearchProvider: Handles search functionality

## Navigation

The application uses a combination of named routes and route generation for navigation between screens.

## UI Components

The UI follows a consistent design language with reusable components for:
- Entry cards
- Comment sections
- User profiles
- Form elements

## Future Improvements

- Implement caching for offline support
- Add real-time updates using Firebase listeners
- Improve performance for list views with large datasets
- Add comprehensive test coverage
